# space fantasy football
This is a football (soccer) management game running entirely on the browser, but with some different rules taken from the NBA system, like:
* roughly the NBA contractual system, so yes, you can't buy players
* the draft system with some differences
of course being this a fantasy game, all players are randomly generated for each new game.

feel free to poke around and or leave some suggestion.
the ui code is located at src/pages, all the rest is related to the game.

### support
because the usage of many recent features, it is advised to use the latest browser version available, for all major browsers (TODO the motivation)
